## About

A screensaver for macOS written in Swift and SpriteKit. Roots its idea in [Barycentric Subdivision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_subdivision), but instead of taking the midpoint at half way the midpoint is animated between 0 and 1.

Inspired by this [Numberphile video](https://youtu.be/Uc0T8IvtBvE)
